/**
 * extractSequence — derive the in-flight tool-call sequence from
 * `scope.history` for `PermissionChecker.check()`.
 *
 * Pattern: Pure function over conversation history.
 * Role:    Single source of truth — sequence is reconstructed on
 *          demand from `LLMMessage[]` instead of maintained as
 *          parallel state in scope. Survives `agent.resumeOnError`
 *          correctly because the history IS the durable artifact.
 * Emits:   N/A (pure compute).
 *
 * The sequence reads the assistant turns' `toolCalls` blocks in order.
 * Calls that were denied at the gate (synthetic tool_results in history
 * but no `tool.execute()` invocation) are NOT included — the sequence
 * reflects what actually dispatched, not what was attempted.
 *
 * Detection of "did this call dispatch?" — we look at the matching
 * `tool` message and check its content. Synthetic deny messages match
 * a known prefix; everything else is a real dispatch. This pairs the
 * sender (assistant.toolCalls[i].id) with the receiver (tool.toolCallId).
 */

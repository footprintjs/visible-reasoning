/**
 * thinkingRedaction — content scrubbing for ThinkingBlock[] before
 * persistence + audit-log adapters fire.
 *
 * Pattern: Pure function. Same shape as the v2.4 RedactionPolicy.scope-
 * patterns / emit-patterns helpers — regex match + replace.
 *
 * Mental model — TWO-LAYER persistence:
 *   - LLMMessage.thinkingBlocks IS persisted to scope.history (required
 *     for Anthropic signature round-trip).
 *   - Audit-log adapters (CloudWatch, Datadog OTel, etc.) read from
 *     scope.history. Sensitive reasoning (PII in chain-of-thought,
 *     internal IDs the model worked through) lands there too.
 *   - This helper scrubs content patterns BEFORE the assistant message
 *     pushes to scope.history, so the audit-log surface only sees
 *     redacted content while the LLM still sees the unredacted reasoning
 *     for round-trip integrity.
 *
 * The signature field is NEVER touched by redaction — Anthropic's
 * server-side signature is bound to the original content; modifying
 * content here would invalidate the signature. Resolution: signature
 * survives byte-exact, content gets scrubbed. This means the Anthropic
 * API will reject the next turn IF the consumer wired thinkingPatterns
 * AND uses Anthropic with extended-thinking-plus-tools. Document.
 *
 * Recommended use:
 *   - DON'T wire thinkingPatterns when using Anthropic extended thinking
 *     + tool calls (signature breaks).
 *   - DO wire thinkingPatterns when using OpenAI o1/o3 (no signature,
 *     no round-trip requirement) or for offline log scrubbing.
 *   - For Anthropic + sensitive reasoning, prefer audit-log-side
 *     redaction (filter in your CloudWatch / Datadog adapter rather
 *     than the framework's persistence point).

/**
 * skillGraph check-up — build-time validation of a declared graph.
 *
 * Pure + side-effect-free. Catches wiring mistakes at authoring time instead of
 * mid-run: a skill nobody can reach, an edge to a skill that isn't in the graph,
 * two un-prioritized edges leaving one skill, a graph with no start, a self-loop.
 *
 * Surfaced two ways:
 *   • `graph.checkup()` → `{ ok, problems }` — always available, call it whenever.
 *   • `.build({ check: 'throw' | 'warn' | 'off' })` — run it at build time.
 *
 * `unreachable-skill` is a WARNING, not an error: a skill with no incoming edge is
 * still legitimately reachable by the model via `read_skill`. Only `unknown-skill`
 * and `no-entry` are true errors.

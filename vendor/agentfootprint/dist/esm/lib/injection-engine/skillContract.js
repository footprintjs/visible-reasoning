/**
 * Skill-body ↔ tool-contract consistency check (Proposal 009, Tier 1).
 *
 * A skill's `body` (prose injected into the system prompt) can quietly contradict
 * the tools it actually unlocks, and the model then **refuses a tool that is right
 * there** — or is told about one it can't call. The library already knows each
 * skill's real tool set (`inject.tools`), so it can flag the mismatch at authoring
 * time instead of at run time.
 *
 * Tier 1 is DETERMINISTIC (no LLM): pure string + schema checks. The semantic
 * contradictions it can't see — e.g. "the body calls an OPTIONAL arg required" —
 * are Tier 2 (LLM-advisory, opt-in). Both checks here are WARNINGS, never errors:
 * a body naming a foreign tool is often an intentional `read_skill` handoff hint.

/**
 * defineRelevanceHint — an advisory system-prompt note for an ambiguous entry.
 *
 * When `entryByRelevance()` picks the starting skill but the top candidates are a
 * NEAR-TIE under the relevance scorer, this injection drops a NON-BINDING note into
 * the system prompt for that turn: "an offline scorer found these close; it can't
 * see the conversation — use your own judgment." A hint, not an order.
 *
 * Anti-anchoring is the point (the proxy is a rough keyword match, not the model's
 * own reasoning), so the note is framed as advisory and only fires on a real tie.
 * It rides the normal injection path (`context.evaluated`) — no new event. Reads
 * `ctx.entryScores` (set by the PickEntry stage), so it needs `.entryByRelevance()`.
 *
 * Add it explicitly: `Agent.create(...).skillGraph(graph).injection(defineRelevanceHint())`.

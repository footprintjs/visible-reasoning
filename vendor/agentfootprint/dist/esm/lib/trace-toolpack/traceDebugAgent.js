/**
 * traceDebugAgent — the DEDICATED conversational door over a completed
 * run's trace. One call returns a ready Agent whose entire catalog is
 * the trace toolpack and whose system prompt is the proven debugging
 * methodology (overview → drill by id → cite evidence → respect ⚠).
 *
 * The counterpart doors over the same evidence:
 *   - the UI (BacktrackView / Lens) for humans who LOOK,
 *   - `.selfExplain()` for why-questions INSIDE the main conversation
 *     (which, in delegate mode, runs one of these under the hood).
 *
 * Why dedicated (B13 posture): trace views can replay adversarial text
 * from the original run — a SEPARATE session over a COMPLETED run keeps
 * that out of the production conversation. It is also the cheap-model
 * story made real: debug a Sonnet/Opus run with a Haiku-priced session
 * that reads only what it opens, by id (~9% of the trace in the
 * example-01 fixture; the gap widens with run size).

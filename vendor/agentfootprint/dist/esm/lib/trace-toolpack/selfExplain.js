/**
 * selfExplain — the IN-CONVERSATION door over the agent's own trace.
 *
 * `.selfExplain()` on the builder mounts ONE skill plus ONE scoped tool
 * provider. Day to day the tool catalog carries only the skill's
 * activation row — the trace tools are NOT in the skill (skill `tools`
 * land in the static registry, exposed every iteration); they ride a
 * `skillScopedTools` provider gated on the skill's activation, composed
 * with whatever provider the consumer already set. When the user asks a
 * why-question the LLM activates the skill, and the NEXT iteration's
 * catalog gains the trace tools, bound to the agent's own PREVIOUS
 * COMPLETED run.
 *
 * The two pieces here:
 *
 * 1. `SelfExplainBinding` — the late-binding seam, a plain CombinedRecorder
 *    attached like any consumer recorder (zero engine changes):
 *
 *      - capture at `onRunEnd`/`onRunFailed`: the just-finished run's
 *        snapshot becomes the explainable evidence (a FAILED run is
 *        still a completed trace — "why did you fail?" works);
 *      - rotate at `onRunStart`: a FRESH ControlDepRecorder per run. The
 *        retired instance never sees the new run's events, so its live
 *        `asLookup()` survives Convention-4's runId reset — the captured
 *        control edges stay valid for the whole next turn.
 *
 *    B13 safety lives here: `Agent.run()` reassigns its executor at run
 *    START, so resolving artifacts mid-run through `getLastSnapshot()`
 *    would expose the IN-FLIGHT run. Capturing only at terminal flush
 *    means the binding can never serve anything but a completed run.
 *
 * 2. `buildSelfExplainSkill` — the skill in two modes:
 *
 *      - INLINE (default): the skill unlocks the 5 trace tools in the
 *        main agent's own loop (same model).
 *      - DELEGATE: the skill unlocks ONE tool — `explain_run(question)` —
 *        whose execute runs a nested `traceDebugAgent` on the consumer's
 *        chosen (cheaper) provider/model and returns its evidence-cited
 *        answer. The main conversation pays for one tool call; the
 *        trace-walking loop happens at the delegate's price. Loaded via
 *        dynamic import so the builder never statically pulls Agent
 *        through this module (no core ↔ lib cycle).

/**
 * lazyTraceToolpack — the toolpack with LATE-BOUND artifacts.
 *
 * `traceToolpack(artifacts)` is a factory over FROZEN artifacts: it
 * precomputes an index and even bakes step-id enums into tool schemas.
 * That is right for the dedicated debugger (the run is already complete
 * when you build it) — and wrong for `.selfExplain()`, where the tools
 * are defined at Agent BUILD time but must read the agent's own *previous
 * completed run*, which changes every turn.
 *
 * This wrapper splits the two lifetimes:
 *
 *   - SCHEMAS are built once from an empty template (artifact-independent —
 *     no id enums, generic descriptions; the same shape `traceToolpack`
 *     itself produces past the enum cap), so the tools can be mounted on
 *     a skill before any run exists.
 *   - EXECUTION resolves `resolve()` per call, builds the REAL toolpack
 *     over the resolved artifacts (memoized by snapshot identity — one
 *     index per completed run, not per call), and delegates through
 *     `callTraceTool` so arg validation matches the eager path.
 *
 * When `resolve()` returns undefined (no completed run yet), every tool
 * answers with an honest, model-visible message instead of throwing —
 * the same #9 philosophy as the toolpack's unknown-id corrections.

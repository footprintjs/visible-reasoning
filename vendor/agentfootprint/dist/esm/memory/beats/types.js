/**
 * Narrative beats — the unit of narrative memory.
 *
 * A `NarrativeBeat` is a self-contained summary extracted from one or
 * more messages during a turn. Instead of persisting raw conversation
 * forever, a narrative pipeline compresses each turn into beats and
 * recalls them by composing beats back into a coherent story.
 *
 * Core properties:
 *   - **Summary**: a single sentence describing what happened.
 *   - **Importance**: 0..1 score the picker uses to prefer salient
 *     beats when the context-token budget is tight.
 *   - **Refs**: ids of the source messages the beat was extracted
 *     from. Lets consumers walk backwards from a recalled beat to
 *     the raw source — the explainability story.
 *   - **Category**: optional free-form tag (e.g. `"identity"`,
 *     `"preference"`, `"fact"`). Extractors / consumers pick their
 *     own taxonomy.
 *
 * Beats are persisted via the ordinary `MemoryStore` interface —
 * `MemoryEntry<NarrativeBeat>` slots in unchanged. No storage changes
 * needed to support narrative memory.

 * Clamp a value to the valid [0, 1] importance range. Non-finite

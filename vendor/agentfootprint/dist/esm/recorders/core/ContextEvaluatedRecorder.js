/**
 * ContextEvaluatedRecorder — forwards the `agentfootprint.context.evaluated`
 * emit to the dispatcher.
 *
 * Pattern: Factory (GoF) returning an EmitBridge instance.
 * Role:    The InjectionEngine `typedEmit`s `context.evaluated` (the
 *          "what was considered / active / skipped + why" summary). Unlike the
 *          other `context.*` events — which `ContextRecorder` DISPATCHES by
 *          observing scope writes — this one is emitted complete by the stage,
 *          so it just needs forwarding (the EmitBridge pass-through pattern,
 *          same as StreamRecorder / AgentRecorder).
 * Why a full-name prefix: scoped to EXACTLY `agentfootprint.context.evaluated`
 *          (not the whole `context.*` domain) so it never double-dispatches
 *          `context.slot_composed`, which IS `typedEmit`'d in the viz chart
 *          (`buildMessageApiChart`) while ALSO being dispatched by
 *          `ContextRecorder` from writes in the runtime charts.
 * Emits:   agentfootprint.context.evaluated

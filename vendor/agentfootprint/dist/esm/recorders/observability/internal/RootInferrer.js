/**
 * @internal — not part of the public agentfootprint API. Imported only
 * by RunStepRecorder. Subject to change without notice.
 *
 * RootInferrer — small state machine deciding whether a run's root is
 * a single leaf primitive (Agent / LLMCall) or a composition (Sequence
 * / Parallel / Conditional / Loop).
 *
 * Extracted from RunStepRecorder per Convention 1.
 *
 * Inputs: subflow entries (with their depth + parsed primitiveKind),
 * fork events (depth 0 → Parallel root), decision events (depth 0 →
 * Conditional root), loop events (depth 0 → Loop root).
 *
 * Output: query `kind()` for the inferred root. Returns `undefined`
 * until a signal arrives.
 *
 * Inference rules:
 *   - Decisive composition signals (fork / decide / loop AT DEPTH 0)
 *     lock the root and are never overridden.
 *   - Shallowest primitive boundary IS a composition kind → root is
 *     that composition.
 *   - Two+ leaf siblings at the shallowest depth → implicit Sequence
 *     root (Sequence-as-runner case where the Sequence itself doesn't
 *     fire its own subflow.entry).
 *   - Single leaf at the shallowest depth → root is "leaf".

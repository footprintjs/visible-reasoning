/**
 * buildToolRegistry — pure function that composes the agent's
 * augmented tool registry from three sources:
 *
 *   1. **Static registry** — tools registered via `.tool()`. Always
 *      visible to the LLM; always executable.
 *   2. **`read_skill`** — auto-attached when ≥1 Skill is registered.
 *      Activation tool for LLM-guided Skills.
 *   3. **Skill-supplied tools** (`Skill.inject.tools[]`) — visible
 *      only when the Skill is active (filtered by tools-slot subflow);
 *      MUST always be in the executor registry so when the LLM calls
 *      one, the tool-calls handler can dispatch.
 *
 * Tool-name uniqueness is enforced across all three sources at build
 * time. The LLM only sees `tool.schema.name` (no ids), so names ARE
 * the runtime dispatch key — collisions break the LLM's ability to
 * call the right tool. Throw early instead of subtly shadowing.
 *
 * **Block C runtime — `autoActivate: 'currentSkill'` semantics:**
 * When a skill's `defineSkill({ autoActivate: 'currentSkill' })` is
 * set, its tools are EXCLUDED from the static registry. They flow
 * into the LLM's tool list ONLY through `dynamicSchemas` (the
 * buildToolsSlot path that reads activeInjections), which means
 * they're visible ONLY on iterations after the skill is activated by
 * `read_skill('id')`. Without this, the LLM sees every skill's tools
 * on every iteration and the per-skill-narrowing autoActivate
 * promised in `defineSkill` doesn't actually narrow anything. Skills
 * WITHOUT autoActivate keep the v2.4 behavior (tools always visible)
 * for back-compat.
 *
 * **autoActivate dispatch invariant:** autoActivate skill tools live
 * OUTSIDE the LLM-visible registry (so they don't pollute the
 * per-iteration tool list before the skill activates), but they MUST
 * still be findable by the dispatch handler — the LLM calls them by
 * name once the skill is active, and dispatch looks up by name. We
 * add them to the dispatch map (`registryByName`) so `lookupTool`
 * resolves correctly.
